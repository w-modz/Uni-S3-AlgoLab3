# ADR 0: Record Architecture Decisions

2023-06-01

## Context

Each decision should be recorded along with the context in which it was made, and the status of the decision.

## Decision

Use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

The documenting process SHOULD provide an opportunity to discuss the architecture and design decisions before they are finalised.
The project SHOULD be more understandable to new developers joining the project.
